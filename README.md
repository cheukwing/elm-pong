# elm-pong

Game of Pong made to test my understanding of the Elm architecture, as well as a refresher on web development and functional programming.

## Running

This project was made using `create-elm-app`, and so can be simply run locally via:
```
  elm-app start 
```
I am not planning on deploying this.

## Debrief

It was also nice to include some quick intersections with inspiration from my Graphics module earlier this year.

The recommended style guide adds a lot of whitespace which is not particularly to my taste as the functions tend to become overly tall - but this may be more as result of my less-than-stellar method of code splitting.

While I have not played around with SVG in any capacity beforehand, the integration with Elm was very intuitive and the only painful part was the strong-typedness of Elm forcing an abundance of `String.fromInt`.
